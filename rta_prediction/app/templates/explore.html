            The main dataset we used for this project is the one retrieved from Kaggle. This dataset contains details about 1.6 million traffic accidents that took place in the UK between 2000 and 2014. These details include the location, time, severity of the accidents as well their meteorological and traffic backdrops. This dataset was originally amassed by various British regional and municipal governments. In this project, we only used the portion of the dataset that recorded RTAs in Greater London between 2012 and 2014.
        </p>
        <p class="text-color" style="font-size:20px;">
            Upon exploring the preprocessed dataset, we discovered locations where accidents happen frequently. We then used the DBSCAN algorithm to group these locations into clusters, which we then referred to as "accident hotspots". We selected DBSCAN due to its ability to find arbitrarily shaped clusters and its robustness to outliers.

            <p class="text-color" style="font-size:20px;">
                We then performed further exploration of this dataset. We found out that RTA probabilities were correlated with several features, including <b>days of the week</b> , <b>time of the day and location</b> and the <b>wheather condition</b> . We elaborated our finding in the following subsection (Observations). We try out different algorithms to predict the probability of accidents happening in those accident hotspots. Python was used for all model training. We found that the best performing model was <b class="text-primary">Random Forest.</b>

        <p class="text-color" style="font-size:20px;">
            As mentioned above, we performed density-based clustering (DBSCAN) to group together accident points into several "hotspots". We then tested four classification models to find RTA probability in the hotspots. We found that Random Forest performs the best, as measured by accuracy and area-under-the-curve (AUC)
        </p>
        <p class="text-color" style="font-size:20px;">
            The summary of the performance of our algorithms is provided below. We believe that have we had additional time, performing further hyperparameter tuning could yield better results.
